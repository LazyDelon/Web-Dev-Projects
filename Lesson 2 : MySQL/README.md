## üìã Setting up your environment

**Please go to the official website to download XAMPP through the following link. The official website is called Apache Firiends. Because it is not called XAMPP, it is often mistaken for not being the official website. However, it is actually the official website for downloading XAMPP.**

**You can download Visual Studio Code [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/zh_tw/index.html).**




### üéì XAMPP

**XAMPP is a software package that can easily integrate Apache (web server), PHP (server-side language), Perl (programming language) and MariaDB (database). Through XAMPP, you can quickly and easily set up a website.**

**When setting up a website, we need to use a web server to allow visitors to connect to our website. Currently, the more common web servers include Apache HTTP server (Apache for short) and Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS for short). Web pages (including various files such as images, videos, etc.) can be provided to the requester through the web server.**

**There are currently many websites that use PHP + MySQL. For example, the well-known WordPress is a free and open source content management system that uses PHP and MySQL as the platform. Therefore, whether it is used for a completely self-hosted website (a website written by oneself) or using CMS such as WordPress and Joomla All can be set up through XAMPP.**

**XAMPP installation is not difficult, just click a series of "YES" and "NEXT". Finally, just pay attention to the installation service selection screen. If the server is at home, just select Apache and MySQL. If If the server will be placed elsewhere, you need to check File Zilla FTP Server. This is an FTP software used to upload other data.**

### üéì Basic environment description

**Finally, let‚Äôs briefly explain the basic environment of XAMPP:**

$\color{red}{\textsf{1. Red box: Service and status area. When the service is started, the Module status area will turn green.}}$

$\color{blue}{\textsf{2. Blue box: Execution code, PID(s) refers to the execution code of the service on the operating system, which can be compared with the work administrator.}}$

$\color{orange}{\textsf{3. Orange box: Channel used by the service.}}$

$\color{purple}{\textsf{4. Purple box: Service control area, used to start and stop servers and modify configuration files.}}$

$\color{green}{\textsf{5. Green box: Service execution status report, used to report the current service execution status.}}$



### üéì Open the Web page

**Now just click on Apache's start button and you're done. At this point, the Start button will change to the Stop button. If you need to turn it off, press Stop again. If you want to completely exit xampp, you need to press the Quit button in the lower right corner to completely exit.(If you cannot exit normally, [please refer to: XAMPP cannot exit normally](https://kumo.tw/article.php?id=16).)**
