### ðŸ“‹ Setting up your environment 

**This curriculum has a development environment ready to go! As you get started you can choose to run the curriculum in a  [Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces/) (_a browser-based, no installs needed environment_), or locally on your computer using a text editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon).**


#### Running the curriculum locally on your computer

**To run this curriculum locally on your computer, you will need a text editor, browser and command line tool. Our first lesson, [Introduction to Programming Languages and Tools of the Trade](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/tree/main/1-getting-started-lessons/1-intro-to-programming-languages), will walk you through various options for each of these tools for you to select what works best for you.**

**Our recommendation is to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) as your editor, which also has a built-in [Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon). You can download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon).**
