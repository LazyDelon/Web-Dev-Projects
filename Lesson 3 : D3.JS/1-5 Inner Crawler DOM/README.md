#### ðŸŽ“ Document Object Model (DOM)

* **The Document Object Model (DOM) is the programming interface for HTML, XML, and SVG documents. It provides a structured representation of a document (tree) and defines methods that allow programs to access and change the document's structure, style, and content. DOM provides a structured representation of documents consisting of nodes and objects that have properties and functions. Nodes can also have event handlers attached, which will be executed once the event is triggered. Essentially, it links web pages or programming languages â€‹â€‹together.**

* **Although JavaScript is often used to access the DOM, it is not Part of the JavaScript language, and it can also be accessed by other languages, such as Java, C, etc.**

#### ðŸŽ“ Operations on the DOM

* **JavaScript can change all HTML elements in the page**

* **JavaScript can change all HTML attributes in the page**

* **JavaScript can change all CSS styles in the page**

* **JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes**

* **JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes**

* **JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page**

* **JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page**

**Note: The interaction between JavaScript and HTML is handled through events, which occur when the user or browser operates on the page. When the page is loading, an event is called. When the user clicks the button, the click is also an event. Other examples include events such as pressing any key, closing the window, resizing the window, etc.**
