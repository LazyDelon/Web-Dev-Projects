# Web Development for Beginners - D3.JS

## ðŸ“£ What is D3?


* **The full name of D3 is `Data-Driven Documents`, you know it is a Data-driven documentation.**

* **In fact, it is a JavaScript function library . Using it, the main If it is used for data visualization.**

* **D3 provides a variety of easy-to-use functions that simplify JavaScript operations The difficulty of the data.**

* **Because it is JavaScript itself, you can also use JavaScript realize all functions, but D3 can reduce the workload of engineers, especially Itâ€™s about data visualization.**

* **D3 simplifies the complex steps of visualization into a few simple functions. Engineers only need to input a few simple data to convert it into various graphics.**




## ðŸ“£ Why use D3.JS

**There are now some chart libraries from Open sources, such as Echarts,
HighCharts, G2.js, etc. So what is the difference between D3 and these chart libraries?**

* **D3 is based on SVG, which enlarges images without distortion. (Because D3.js v4 version already supports canvas).**

* **Choosing D3, you can develop any imaginable chart in your mind, giving designers a lot of freedom in design.**

* **D3 is relatively low-level, but once you master the design method and its simplicity, it is more handy than other tools. The following figure shows the difference between D3 and other visualization tools:**

## ðŸ“£ What is SVG

**SVG, which stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, is a graphics format used to describe two-dimensional vector graphics. It is an open standard developed by W3C.**

**SVG can use XML format to define graphics. Except for versions before IE8, most browsers support SVG and can embed SVG text directly into HTML for display. SVG has the following features:**

* **SVG draws vector graphics, so there will be no distortion when the image is enlarged.**

* **Based on XML, JavaScript event handlers can be added to each element.**

* **Each graphic is considered an object, and if you change the properties of the object, the graphic will also change.**

**What knowledge is required?**
  
* **HTML: used to configure web content**
  
* **CSS: used to style web pages**
  
* **JavaScript: an interpreter language (Interpreter) used to set the behavior of web pages**

* **SVG: Scalable vector graphics for drawing visual graphics**

## ðŸŽ“ HyperText Markup Language (HTML)

**As we know, HTML is used to structure the content of the webpage. It is stored in a text file with the extension ".html". For example,**


```HTML
<!DOCTYPE HTML>

<html>
    <head>
        
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title> æ–‡æª”æ¨™é¡Œ </title>

    <body>
        
        æ–‡æª”å…§å®¹...
    </body>
</html>
```

## ðŸŽ“ Document Object Model (DOM)

**The full name of DOM is Document Object Model. The Chinese translation is Document Object Model. It looks very abstract, but in fact it defines each tag in an HTML document, including text, pictures, etc., as objects, and these objects will eventually form a [**Tree structure**](https://hackmd.io/@qhrUT5qfQ9uYar_RFMX-PQ/Skp8Q1Eed)   , there is a schematic diagram below for reference.**
