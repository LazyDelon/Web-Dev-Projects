## 📣 What is HTML5?

**HTML5 is the fifth revised version of HTML. The standard was completed by W3C in October 2014.**

**Broadly speaking, HTML5 refers to a set of technology combinations that include HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These three technologies have also been innovated, with the purpose of reducing the need for plug-ins in web browsers, such as: Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight, and Oracle JavaFX. And provide more standards sets that can effectively enhance network applications.**

**Among them, HTML5 has added new projects that in the past could only be completed with Flash.For example, functions such as video, audio, drawing, and animation...Adobe Flash will cease to be fully updated in 2020, and the affected mainstream browsers will stop supporting Adobe Flash!**

**HTML5 not only adds new audio and video functions, but also adds many more meaningful grammatical features and elements, using grammatical tags to make the structure simpler! In the past, websites would be full of `<div>` and `<table>` wrapping content, but now you only need to use `<section>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>` and `<nav>`, so that The source code of the web page is more simplified and structured, so that crawlers can better understand the content of the website, thus improving search engine rankings!**

## 📋 Setting up your environment

### Create a new folder for your website

#### 1. Open Visual Studio Code。

&nbsp;&nbsp; **When you start Visual Studio Code, the Welcome page opens.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp; **Note that you can create new files or open folders in the Start list.**

#### 2. Open Folder

- [ ] **Select Open Folder from the Start list in Welcome,**  
- [ ] **Select File > Open Folder from the Visual Studio Code menu.**

## 🌱 Quickstart - HTML Tag Structure

**A minimal HTML Tag Structure looks something like this：**  
**You can open it in the Example.html file in the 1 - Structure folder.**

```html
<!Doctype HTML>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>
			My Website
		</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		Hello, World!	
	</body>
</html>
```














```bash
                    ╭┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈╮
                    ┆  Element  ┆
                    ╰┈┈┈┈┈┬┈┈┈┈┈╯
                          ▼ 
     ╭┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┴┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈╮
  開始標籤              文本内容               結束標籤
     ▼               ╰┈┈┈┈┬┈┈┈┈╯               ▼
╭┈┈┈┈┴┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┴┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┴┈┈┈┈╮

#### 1. HTML5 Semantic Layout Section

**There are many new semantic tags (semantic elements) in the HTML5 standard, which allow web pages to create more semantically structured content, helping search engines and developers to more clearly interpret the structure of web pages, so making good use of HTML5 semantic tags can also Enhance the SEO (search engine optimization) of web pages.**

**The main semantic structure tags of HTML5 are `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, and `<aside>`。Use semantic tags to replace the semantically meaningless `<div>` in older versions.**

#### 2. HTML5 Web Storage

**HTML5 provides a technology that can store data on the client side, which is divided into "Local Storage" and "Session Storage". The difference between the two is：**

* **Local Storage：can store data across pages, and the data will not disappear when the page is closed (for example: some website forms will still remember the information entered before when we close and reopen them halfway through filling in the form)**

* **Session Storage: Data cannot be stored across pages. The data will disappear when the page is closed.**

| **Parameters** | **Local Storage** | **Session Storage** | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| **Capacity** | **10 Mb** | **5 Mb** | 
| **Browser** | **HTML5** | **HTML5** | 
| **Accessible from** | **Any Window** | **Same tab** |
| **Expires** | **Never** | **On tab close** |
| **Storage location** | **Browser only** | **Browser only** | 
| **Sent with requests** | **No** | **No** |


#### 3. HTML5 Device Access

**HTML5 provides the function of API connection, which allows external applications to connect with the data inside the browser, so that the data can be connected and communicated across platforms. For example, adding Google Maps to the web page allows the map to be used directly on the web page. There is no need to enable paging separately, this is what the API does.**

&nbsp; <img src="./Images/HTML5_APIs.svg" alt="HTML5_API"/>

#### 4. HTML5 Connectivity

**HTML5 has a more efficient server push technology, which uses server-sent events and two-way communication technology WebSockets to bring a more efficient connection solution.**

##### 4-1 What is WebSocket?

**WebSocket is a network transmission protocol provided by HTML5 and is one of the ways for the browser (Client) and the server (Server) to exchange data.**

**The HTTP or HTTPS protocols we are more familiar with are also located in the application layer of the OSI model and are based on the TCP protocol of the transport layer. The biggest difference is that the WebSocket protocol only needs to be connected once to maintain two-way communication without repeatedly sending Requests, so the response is more immediate, thus improving the speed of Web communication.**

##### 4-2 Why WebSocket?

* **The HTTP protocol can only send requests "one-way" from the client, and cannot be actively sent by the server. The WebSocket protocol allows the server to actively push data to the client, realizing a "two-way communication" mechanism.**

* **Through HTTP 1.1 persistent connection (keep-alive), it effectively solves the performance problems caused by HTTP polling (Polling) and saves server resources.**

* **Practical examples: message push, instant chat room, co-editing and other functions.**
